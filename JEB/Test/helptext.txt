USAGE
%prog% [options] ${[test-name] ...}$

Executes the unit tests in %prog%.

ARGUMENTS
  test-name
    The name of the test or tests that will be run. All tests are run if no test names are given. If the --exclude option is used, all tests except the given ones are run.

    Tests are typically arranged in a two-level hierarchy with a parent and several child-tests. To disable a parent test and all its children, just enter the name of the parent. To disable a specific child, enter the names of both the parent and the child separated by a single "/".

    Example:
        If the tests are arranged like this:

            test_Sys:
                test_Path:
                    test_splitExtension
                    test_join
                    test_normalize
                test_Environment:
                    test_read
                    test_setValue
            test_String:
                test_join
                test_split

        To only run tests in test_Sys, use

            %prog% test_Sys

        To run all tests in test_Path, use

            %prog% test_Sys/test_Path

        To only run test_Join under test_Path, use

            %prog% test_Sys/test_Path/test_join

GENERAL OPTIONS
${-h --help}$
    Show program help.
${-e --exclude}$
    Exclude the named tests and run everything else. This is the opposite of the default behavior.
${-l FILE, --log-file=FILE}$
    Redirect all the output the tests normally write to stdout or stderr to a file named FILE instead. (This does not affect the test reports).
${-q --quiet | Member: verbose | Value: false}$
    Don't display extra information while running tests. (Opposite of -v.)
${-v --verbose | Default: true}$
    Display extra information while running tests.

REPORT OPTIONS
${--junit}$
    Produce a test report in the JUnit XML format.
${--text}$
    Produce a plain text test report that only list failed tests. This is the default.
${--fulltext}$
    Produce a plain text test report that lists all tests.
${-f FILE, --file=FILE}$
    The name of the report file. If multiple report files are produced, FILE will have the suitable file type extension appended to it (txt, xml etc.). Test reports are written to stdout if this option isn't used.
${--host=HOST}$
    Set the host name. This option has no effect on tests; it's only included in the test report.
