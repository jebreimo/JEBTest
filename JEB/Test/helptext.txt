USAGE
%usage%

Executes unit tests.

ARGUMENTS
$ test name | maxcount: 0
    The name of the test or tests that will be run. All tests are run if no
    test names are given. If the --exclude option is used, all tests except
    the given ones are run.

    Tests are typically arranged in a two-level hierarchy with a parent and
    several child-tests. To disable a parent test and all its children, just
    enter the name of the parent. To disable a spesific child enter the names
    of both the parent and the child, separated with a single "/".
$ out-file
    The name of the file that some kind of output will be written to. This is a
    text file.

GENERAL OPTIONS
-e --exclude
    Exclude the tests whose names appear after the options and run everything
    else. This is the opposite of the default behavior.
-h --help
    Show program help.
-l: --log-file=FILE
    Redirect all the output the tests normally write to stdout or stderr to
    a file named FILE instead. (This does not affect the test reports).
-q --quiet | name: verbose | value: false
    Don't display extra information while running tests. (Opposite of -v.)
-v --verbose
    Display extra information while running tests.

REPORT OPTIONS
--junit
    Produce a test report in the JUnit XML format.
--text
    Produce a plain text test report that only list failed tests. This is the
    default.
--fulltext
    Produce a plain text test report that lists all tests.
-f: --file=FILE
    The name of the report file. If multiple report files are produced, FILE
    will have the suitable file type extension appended to it (txt, xml etc.).
    Test reports are written to stdout if this option isn't used.
--host=HOST
    Set the host name. This option has no effect on tests, it is only used in the report.
